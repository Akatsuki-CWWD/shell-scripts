# Merazi's script directory

This directory contains a lot of shell scripts, some of them are made
in python, some of them are written in bash shell, and so on... I'll
make sure to add a file extension so it is easier to identify which
scripting language each script uses.

# What can you do with my scripts

+ You can use them for whatever purpose you want
+ You can study them if you want
+ You can redistribute exact copies of my scripts
+ You can redistribute modified versions of my scripts

I bet you're familiar with those four rules. If not, please read the
LICENSE file.
